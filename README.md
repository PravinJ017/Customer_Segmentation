# Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering

## Project Overview

This project aims to categorize a company's customer base into distinct groups to enhance understanding of their behaviors and preferences. We use K-means clustering to segment customers based on features such as purchasing behavior and demographics. The resulting segments are validated for business relevance and presented through clear visualizations.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
    cd customer-segmentation
    ```

2. **Upload the repository to Google Drive**:
    - Upload the entire repository to your Google Drive for easy access in Colab.

3. **Open the notebook**:
    - Open `notebooks/Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` in Google Colab.

4. **Install dependencies**:
    - Install required packages directly in Colab using the following commands:
    ```python
    !pip install -r /path/to/your/requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run

1. **Upload the dataset to Colab**:
    - Upload `Mall_Customers.csv` to the Colab environment or mount your Google Drive containing the dataset.

2. **Run the notebook cells**:
    - Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, perform clustering, and visualize the results.

3. **Analyze the results**:
    - Review the visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the characteristics of each customer segment.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab (for running the notebook)

Install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results

- The project segments customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.
- Visualizations and statistical summaries provide insights into each customer segment, enabling targeted marketing strategies.
